# Valheim - Harder Feather Fall Mod

**_Works with Mistlands Update!_**

Have you ever thought the Feather Cape seemed too OP? Especially outside of the Mistlands biome? Me too. That's why I made this mod. Feather Cape now draws its power from Wisplight. When equipped together, the Feather Fall effects work normally. Otherwise, your fall speed and fall damage protection are proportionally bound to your available stamina. Each becomes more perilous the less stamina you have. Where 100% stamina will provide the expected fall speed and damage reduction benefits, 0% stamina feels like the cape isn't even equipped when falling... or landing.

Users of this mod beware. This is not a QOL improvement, it seeks to reduce the power of the Feather Cape outside of normal Mistlands play.

## Features?

* Feather Cape now requires Wisplight to be equipped in order to function normally
* Absent the Wisplight effect, Feather Fall effects are bound to your available stamina, losing more of their effectiveness the lower your stamina, but the cape does not *consume* your stamina

## Config

The [Official BepInEx ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) is a required dependency.

Configuration allows:

* **Enable Mod**, Enable the mod, default: true
* **Override: Enable even when Wisplight equipped**, Enable even when Wisplight equipped, default: false (Makes play significantly harder)

Built with [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
